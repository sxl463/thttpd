thttpd - tiny HTTP server

thttpd is a simple, small, portable, fast, and secure HTTP server.

Simple: It handles only the minimum necessary to implement HTTP/1.1.

Small: It has a very small run-time size, since it does not fork and is very careful about memory allocation.

Secure: It goes to great lengths to protect the web server machine against attacks and breakins from other sites.

It also has URL-traffic-based throttling.

See the manual entry for more details. See the INSTALL file for configuration and installation instructions.
